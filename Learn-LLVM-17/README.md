This is the code repository for [Learn LLVM 17](https://www.packtpub.com/product/learn-llvm-17-second-edition/9781837631346?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781837631346), published by Packt.

**A beginner's guide to learning LLVM compiler tools and core libraries with C++**

## What is this book about?
LLVM was built to bridge the gap between the theoretical knowledge found in compiler textbooks and the practical demands of compiler development. With a modular codebase and advanced tools, LLVM empowers developers to build compilers with ease. This book serves as a practical introduction to LLVM, guiding you progressively through complex scenarios and ensuring that you navigate the challenges of building and working with compilers like a pro.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Configure, compile, and install the LLVM framework
* Understand how the LLVM source is organized
* Discover what you need to do to use LLVM in your own projects
* Explore how a compiler is structured, and implement a tiny compiler
* Generate LLVM IR for common source language constructs
* Set up an optimization pipeline and tailor it for your own needs
* Extend LLVM with transformation passes and clang tooling
* Add new machine instructions and a complete backend

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
#include "llvm/IR/IRPrintingPasses.h"
#include "llvm/IR/LegacyPassManager.h"
#include "llvm/Support/ToolOutputFile.h"
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for compiler developers, enthusiasts, and engineers new to LLVM. C++ software engineers looking to use compiler-based tools for code analysis and improvement, as well as casual users of LLVM libraries who want to gain more knowledge of LLVM essentials will also find this book useful. Intermediate-level experience with C++ programming is necessary to understand the concepts covered in this book.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-13).
